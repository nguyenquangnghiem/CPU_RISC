# RISC CPU Architecture Overview

## INTRODUCE
A **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU** is designed to execute a minimal set of simple instructions with high efficiency, ensuring sequential program execution based on simplified processing principles. The CPU performs the following core operations:

1. **Fetch Instruction**  
   - Retrieves the next instruction from memory.
2. **Decode Instruction**  
   - Interprets the fetched instruction to determine the operation.
3. **Fetch Operand Data**  
   - Loads required data from memory (if applicable).
4. **Execute Instruction**  
   - Performs the decoded operation (e.g., arithmetic, logic).
5. **Store Result**  
   - Writes the output back to memory or registers.
