# CPU RISC 8-bit
    CPU RISC is designed to execute a set of simple instructions with high efficiency, ensurìng sequential operation of program according to simple process principles . CPU is capable of performing the following functions : 
    ● Fetch instruction from memory.
    ● Decode instruction.
    ● Fetch oparand data from memory.
    ● execute instruction.
    ● save result.
    ● execution flow mamagement : PC determine current íntruction address then through the address slector  (Address Mux) và Controller, instruction is loaded into                                   memory
